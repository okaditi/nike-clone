## ✨ About the Project

Something came together after the chaos. 🧩  
Post-finals silence has a strange way of making ideas louder. Somewhere between clearing my tabs and clearing my head, this concept surfaced — and I followed it.

This project is a **pixel-perfect front-end clone** of the official **Nike Singapore** website. Built as a design exercise, it replicates the layout, visual style, and responsive behavior of the original site.

> A blank canvas. Some late nights.  
> That itch to get the structure and rhythm right.

### Why Singapore?
The SG angle hit during a college session — I just happened to be connected to a **Singapore server**, and the idea chose its coordinates.
